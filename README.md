## Diabetes Prediction 🩺🔍

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. It leverages data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation—all  within a single Jupyter Notebook.

# 📓 Notebook Overview
The Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb includes:

  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    
  * Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
    
  * Feature Selection
    
  * Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
    
  * Model Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Final Prediction and Visualization

# 🗃️ Dataset
This project likely uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains health-related variables like:
    
   * Number of pregnancies
    
   * Glucose level
    
   * Blood pressure
    
   * Skin thickness
    
   * Insulin
    
   * BMI
    
   * Diabetes Pedigree Function
    
   * Age
    
   * Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

If another dataset is used, update this section accordingly.

# 🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Running the Notebook
Clone this repository.

Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
Run all cells to reproduce the results.

📈 Model Performance
Metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report are used to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.

Update with actual metrics if desired.
